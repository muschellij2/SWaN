Description: Wraps the Python implementation 
  <https://github.com/binodthapachhetry/SWaN> mapped out in 'Detecting Sleep 
  and Nonwear in 24-h Wrist Accelerometer Data from the National Health and 
  Nutrition Examination Survey'
  <https://doi.org/10.1249%2FMSS.0000000000002973> to estimate
  Sleep-wear, Wake-wear, and Non-wear ('SWaN') in wrist-worn accelerometry.  
  Creates a specific 'conda' environment and wrappers apply this to raw 
  data (sub-second) to get an estimate of non-wear in 30 second blocks.
